## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd f:\Hotello

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Setup

1. Create `.env` file in `backend/` directory:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hotello

# Clerk Authentication
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

# Stripe Payment (optional)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key

# Server
PORT=3001
```

2. Seed the database with sample hotels:

```powershell
cd backend
node scripts/seedHotels.js
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Create `.env` file in `frontend/` directory:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## � CI / Deployment

This repository includes CI workflows that validate the frontend and backend on push and pull-request. Deployment is expected to be handled by managed platforms (Vercel / Netlify for the frontend and Render / Railway for the backend).

Workflows added (GitHub Actions):

- `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` — runs in the `backend/` folder and performs install, lint, test, and build steps. The previously included Docker publish job has been removed (not required). Use Render or Railway (or your preferred host) for production deployments.

- `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` — runs in the `frontend/` folder and performs install, lint, test, and build steps. No automatic Pages deployment is configured because frontend deploys are typically handled by Vercel or Netlify.

Notes & recommended setup:

- Vercel / Netlify: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel or Netlify. These providers will build and deploy the `frontend` folder automatically on push to the branches you configure.
- Render / Railway: Connect the `backend` folder (or root) to Render/Railway; configure the service to run `npm start` (or your start script) and set the required environment variables in their dashboard.
- Secrets: No GitHub Actions secrets are required for the standard builds. If you integrate any external registries (Docker Hub, container registry, etc.) you would set corresponding secrets in the GitHub repository settings — but this repo's workflows do not depend on them now.

How to trigger CI locally:

1. Push a branch or open a pull request — GitHub Actions will run the workflows.
2. For manual runs, go to the Actions tab, pick a workflow, and use "Run workflow" (workflow_dispatch is enabled).

If you want me to wire up deployments via the Actions (e.g., automatic deploy to Render via API or push to GitHub Container Registry), I can add those steps — otherwise, using the provider integrations is simpler and recommended.
